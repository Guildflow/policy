### 7. Paid Services  

Some GUILDFLOW Services require payment of a fee. You must have an Account and pay the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities. For information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit <https://guildflow.com/pricing/>. 

**FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE 30 DAYS AFTER PAYMENT.**

GUILDFLOW reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time. If you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for a GUILDFLOW Service, GUILDFLOW will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the GUILDFLOW Service. You are responsible for reviewing the GUILDFLOW Service to obtain timely notice of such changes. Your continued use of the GUILDFLOW Service thirty (30) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but GUILDFLOW will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate fees for any subscription. If your use of GUILDFLOW Services is subject to use or sales tax, then GUILDFLOW may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees. For further information, visit <https://guildflow.com/pricing/>. 

A. **Payment Options.** You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular GUILDFLOW Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose. Payment methods may vary by GUILDFLOW Service. When you provide credit card or other payment information to GUILDFLOW, you represent to GUILDFLOW that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method. By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to permit GUILDFLOW to automatically renew your subscription to a GUILDFLOW Service by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to GUILDFLOW. Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater than GUILDFLOW's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription. You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account. You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify GUILDFLOW if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft). Changes to such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at <hello@guildflow.com>. If you fail to provide GUILDFLOW any of the foregoing information, you agree that GUILDFLOW may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription. GUILDFLOW reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to GUILDFLOW. Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.   

As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends.  

B. **Trial Subscriptions.** For some GUILDFLOW Services, GUILDFLOW may offer a free trial subscription. If you accept a free trial subscription, GUILDFLOW will begin to bill your Account for that GUILDFLOW Service when the free trial subscription expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time. You are always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using GUILDFLOW Services, even when we offer a free trial subscription. Trial subscriptions are not transferrable. 

C. **Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.** We may provide links to other web sites. Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to GUILDFLOW. Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with third parties are your responsibility. 

### 8. Termination of GUILDFLOW Services

GUILDFLOW may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or GUILDFLOW Services (and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular GUILDFLOW Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at GUILDFLOW's discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product or GUILDFLOW Service website at <https://guildflow.com>.  

GUILDFLOW may also terminate access to GUILDFLOW Services for violation of this Terms of Service, if GUILDFLOW (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of GUILDFLOW Services renders GUILDFLOW Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or improper use of GUILDFLOW Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or GUILDFLOW's Intellectual Property as determined by GUILDFLOW in its sole discretion. You may lose your username and persona as a result of termination. If you have more than one (1) Account, GUILDFLOW may terminate all of your Accounts and all related Entitlements. In response to a violation of these Terms of Service or any other agreement applicable to GUILDFLOW Services accessed by you, GUILDFLOW may issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all GUILDFLOW Services or certain GUILDFLOW Services. You acknowledge that in such an instance GUILDFLOW is not required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or all GUILDFLOW Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements associated with your Account. If GUILDFLOW terminates your Account, you may not participate in a GUILDFLOW Service again without GUILDFLOW's express permission. GUILDFLOW reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide GUILDFLOW Services to, any individual. You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been terminated by GUILDFLOW to use your Account. 

If your Account, or a particular subscription for a GUILDFLOW Service associated with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all GUILDFLOW Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account or the particular GUILDFLOW Service. If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at <hello@guildflow.com>. 

### 9. Cancellation of your Account 

You have the right to cancel your Account or a subscription to a GUILDFLOW Service at any time.

### 14. Limitations on Warranty and Liability 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE USE OF GUILDFLOW SERVICES, GUILDFLOW SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. GUILDFLOW SERVICES, GUILDFLOW SOFTWARE, GUILDFLOW PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, GUILDFLOW, GUILDFLOW LICENSORS' AND GUILDFLOW AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

C. **Waiver.** The failure of GUILDFLOW to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be effective only if in a writing signed by GUILDFLOW.

### 18. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration 

The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise. As discussed below in Section 18.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than GUILDFLOW's last settlement offer to you (if any), GUILDFLOW will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award. 

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**  

Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by contacting our customer support at hello@guildflow.com. In the unlikely event that GUILDFLOW cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if GUILDFLOW cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and GUILDFLOW agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us. **This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. By accepting these terms, you and GUILDFLOW expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.** This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly. This Section covers any and all disputes between us ("Disputes"), including without limitation: 

- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;  
- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);

References to "GUILDFLOW," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us. This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service. 

A. **Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.** You and GUILDFLOW agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ("Notice of Dispute"). Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). GUILDFLOW will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: ZORN LABS LLC, 399 Market Street, Suite 360, Philadelphia, PA 19106, ATTENTION: Legal Department. 

B. **Binding Arbitration.** If you and GUILDFLOW are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or GUILDFLOW may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. **YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND GUILDFLOW ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.** The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website <https://www.adr.org>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send GUILDFLOW a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate arbitration, then GUILDFLOW will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and GUILDFLOW may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator, only. 

C. **Restrictions.** You and GUILDFLOW agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between GUILDFLOW and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND GUILDFLOW AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and GUILDFLOW agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. 

D. **Location.** If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Philadelphia, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States of America, and you and GUILDFLOW agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. 

E. **Limitation on Arbitrator's Authority.** The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. 

F. **Changes to This Provision.** Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if GUILDFLOW makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.
